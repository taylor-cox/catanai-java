# Catan AI - ML of the Java Edition
A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Model, featuring Java + PyTorch.

```
Me:          Hey, I made an AI for Catan!
Recruiter:   Amazing! So you're a data scientist with Python expertise?
Me:          Actually I wrote it in Java!
Recruiter:   We're sorry, but we've decided to move forward with other candidates at this 
             time.
```
CatanAI is a project built from a morbid curiousity I had when browsing through
the MVN repository one day (as one does), and stumbling across the 
DeepJavaLibrary. 

"This must be a joke", I thought. 

Turns out the joke was on me.

### Chapter 1: Project Details (Denial)
CatanAI uses Java with Spring Boot 2.7 and the DeepJavaLibrary v0.23.0. In
addition, CatanAI comes with a WebUI written in React 18 to view games the
AI has played against itself. In addition, games played are stored in a 
PostgreSQL Docker container.
